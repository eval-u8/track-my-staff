# Track My Staff ðŸ—„

Track My Staff is a simple command line application that allows you to access, view and manage a database of employees.

## Quirks ðŸŽ¯

The user is able to view employees, add new ones, delete them or just update their data. This is not only to employees, but also to departments they may work at, or roles they might be performing.

As a bonus, there is a table that shows the total budget of the departments.
